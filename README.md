Hello!
Embedded Systems Programming & FPGA Design
This repository contains my projects and lab work from a college-level course focused on embedded systems programming and FPGA design. The course curriculum emphasized hardware description languages and hands-on application development.

Key Course Components:
Platform: Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA development board.
Hardware Description Language: VHDL.
Reference: The course was based on principles from Free Range VHDL by Fabrizio Tappero
Core Concepts: Applied foundational principles of digital logic and embedded systems to build complex designs.

Key Projects & Labs:
 -Lab 1 - Counter: Implemeneted binary counter and display on LEDs for as an introduction to VHDL. It was the first showcase of using debounce circtuitry for the buttons and a 1 MHz clock divider for the Zynq. 
 -Lab 2 - ALU Module: Implemented an Arithmetic Logic Unit to perform fundamental arithmetic and logic operations.
 -Lab 3 - UART Transmission: Created a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter for serial communication between the FPGA and a host PC.
 -Lab 4 - VGA Display: Developed a VHDL module to generate and control a VGA signal for image and text display.

Unfinished:
  - Lab5: Design a using ALU logic gates prcoessor
  - Final Project: Digital Music Synthesizer
